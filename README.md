# Fuzzing

**fuzzing.py** takes keywords from **fuzzing.txt** file and sends a get request to target url with that keyword to see if there is a sub directory or a file. If requests response is **200** it prints that there is a sub directory or a file with the keyword.

**fuzzing_2.py** works the same with **fuzzing.py** if session id or cookies are not necessary.
